#CONSTELLATION

[CONSTELLATION](https://constellation.fun) is a participatory creative-tech experiment in IoT. Its main output is a 64x32 pixel LED matrix module, driven by a Raspberry Pi running a Node app, updated in realtime via a live interface powered by Socket IO. The interface, built with React/Redux is minimal: a grid of clickable dots, one for each of the pixels of the LED matrix, can be changed to any color selected via a color slider component in the header. Below this grid you can see how many people are currently using the app, a number only limited by how many people have the login password. It is a full-CRUD app, any user having the ability to save the state of the matrix to a dropdown gallery as generative canvas pixel elements and pull those states up to view, with delete/update privileges reserved for admins. There is a [client-side](https://github.com/LIGHT-TRIBE/client), a [server-side](https://github.com/LIGHT-TRIBE/server), and an [IoT-side](https://github.com/LIGHT-TRIBE/server) to the app. The idea born from creative brainstorming, and inspired by collaborative aesthetic projects like Reddit Place, CONSTELLATIONâ€™s true merit is in its ability to bring people together through the spirit of fun and teamwork that is the heart of the internet itself.
